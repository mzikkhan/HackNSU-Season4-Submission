# HackNSU Season 4

Problem Statement: Develop a solution that contributes towards a safer online experience for all.

We have developed a platform where an institution's students can report cyber-bullying incidents. They can choose to provide evidence in terms of screenshots or screen
recordings. They can also choose to report it anonymously. This will then be handled by the institution that can store the complaint
on the bully's public student profile to deter future such incidents.

I have developed this project with my teammates, Absara Chowdhury, and Farhan Ishrak Tahmid. We have used simple HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript for the front end and Django for 
the back end. We utilized the SQLite3 database for our data manipulation. 

We ranked 8th in the Hackathon.
